#+TITLE: Dotfiles for i3 on Arch Linux

Welcome to some random dotfiles repo!

This is where I keep the configuration files for my i3 setup on an Arch Linux-based system. It’s taken me a bit longer than expected to get this uploaded... okay, over a year. Sometimes life gets in the way, and, well, I get distracted. Happens to the best of us, right?

The goal with this setup is simple: I want it to be functional, easy on the eyes, and efficient. The plan is to start small but make it better over time.

* What’s in Here Now?

- **i3 configuration**: I use i3 because it’s fast, minimal, and gets out of the way. Just the way I like it.
- **Babashka**: Lightweight Clojure, because sometimes you don’t need a JVM to get things done. I’ve got a little script in here to manage my i3 configs using Babashka.
- **Clojure**: I love working in Clojure, and it’s in my workflow. Expect some configuration for Clojure development down the line.

* What’s Next?

There’s more to come, eventually. I’ve got a few ideas, like:

- **Emacs configuration**: I’m thinking of adding my Emacs setup here. It’s a fantastic editor, and I spend a lot of time in it, so why not share the setup?
- **More Clojure, Babashka, and NBB setup**: For the Clojure enthusiast in me, and maybe for the curious developer out there who enjoys messing around with these tools.

But for now, I’ll keep it simple. No need to overcomplicate things.

* Why Did It Take Over a Year?

Alright, I’ll admit it. It took me over a year to upload this portion of my dotfiles. Sometimes I get distracted. But hey, I’m here now.

* The Plan

1. **Keep the i3 setup solid**: I’m all about simplicity and efficiency.
2. **Add Emacs configuration**: Because Emacs is life (well, almost).
3. **Play with Clojure, Babashka, and NBB**: They make me happy, and I think they could make your setup a bit more interesting too.
4. **Keep things fun**: The whole point is to enjoy what you’re doing. If this setup can make life a little easier and more fun, then great!

* A Final Note

Things might get a little weird here, but it’s all part of the process. It’s a journey, and I’m just sharing a portion of it. I’m not trying to reinvent the wheel—just trying to make things a little smoother.

Hope you find something useful here. And if not, maybe at least a laugh or two.

Your friendly engineer trying to make things work
